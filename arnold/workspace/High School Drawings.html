        <h2 style="color:white;" align="center"><ins>Context</ins></h2>
    <p style="color:white;" align="center">After seventh grade, up to my sophmore year, I lost an interest in drawing. I just felt unmotivated and uninspired to do so. 
    I had no reason to draw other than it was necessary for homework, but even then I carelessly did it, treating more like just another task than a passion I had. 
    It wasn't until the summer after my sophmore year in high school that I regrew an interest in drawing. I was taking US History as a summer course to get ahead. 
    The class was chill and for the first half of the class time we would spend the last half watching watching a documentary. It was a day I got bored more than usually, watching a documentary about presidents, that 
    I opened to the back pages of my notebook and began to draw some sketches. They were mediocre at best, a bunch of 2d sketches that had no visual value. Eventhough I wanted to come up with something, I had a hard time processing what it should be.  
    I looked around the classroom but found nothing of inspirational value. So I looked deeper. I thought, well, what do I like. At the time I was immersed in the game Battlefield 1. It was the start of something.
    What started as a simple sketch evolved into what I call THE AIRSHIP. That moment upon finishing a drawing and feeling proud of what I created inspired me further to draw more. 
    When I had no ideas, I asked people theirs, and then I would draw what they gave me. <p style="color:white;" align="center"><i><ins>DISCLAIMER</ins></i>: Some of my drawings are unique, some are inspired by others, and some are completely base off other drawings from the internet.</p> </p>
