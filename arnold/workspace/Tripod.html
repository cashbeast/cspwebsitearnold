            <p><i>War of the Worlds. Tripod. July 2018.</i> <q>No one would have believed in the last years of the nineteenth century that this 
            world was being watched keenly and closely by intelligences greater than man's and yet as mortal as his own; that as men busied 
            themselves about their various concerns they were scrutinised 
            and studied, perhaps almost as narrowly as a man with a microscope 
            might scrutinise the transient creatures that swarm and multiply in a drop of water.</q>
