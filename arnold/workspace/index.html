    <p align="center">I wake up every morning feeling remorese and regret.<i> Darn, another morning</i>. I'm pretty sure I don't have a soul; at least, the expression on my face indicates that I don't. Always, other than my crippling depression, I'm a huge supernatural buff and an even bigger Star Wars nerd. I guess I'll include that on my resamay. But enough about that, what really defines me is my artistic capabilty; not so much human interaction because I find I'm socially awkward most of the time. 
    And it's what seperate me from society and I mean literally. I have a way of making myelf not ivisible to anyone</p>
